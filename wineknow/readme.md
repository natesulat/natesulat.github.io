# WineKnow
## Helping the lazy and unsophisticated remember what wines they like

The point of this project is to create an SAP that allows a user to easily create a list of wines they like and store it in a Google doc.

The list UI on this page will allow users to enter the name of a bottle of wine, the type of the wine, the year it was made, where it was made, and their 1-10 rating for the wine.

The idea is for a Google user to be easily able to create their list, and then to be able to call it back to the webpage.
